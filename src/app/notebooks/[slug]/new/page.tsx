// This may be combinable with the noteId page
const NewNotebookPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Notebook 4 - A New Note...</h1>
      <p>
        Yeah so this could be combined with the note page as it is basically the
        same, just an empty note waiting to be edited...
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default NewNotebookPage
